(A story about sync daemons and emotional latency.) 

# Latency Issues


“Can you at least close the laptop while we eat?” 

“I missed three attestations this afternoon. I think the sync daemon failed.“

“You're not speaking English again.”


“The node syncs its clock via NTP but it’s not working. The clock is slow.”

“Your computer was late?”

“By 0.17 seconds. That’s the problem.”

She sits. Forks a bit of salad. Waits.

The screen reflects green and purple in his glasses.

“If the daemon doesn’t resynch, I’ll keep losing slots. You realise what that means?”

“I realize my pasta’s cold.”

“I’m bleeding ETH for every missed attestation.”

“There’s a penalty every epoch.”

“So it costs you money?”

“It costs the network.”

“God, you are doing the meme voice.”

He doesn’t hear her. “Honestly, I don’t know that I’m up to running a full validator node. If we had proper light clients I’d jump at it. Like the guy doing a proof-of-concept for smart TVs.”

“Joy. I can’t wait for you to tell me that my toothbrush needs to validate.”

“Verify. That’s not a joke. There’s an open bounty on zk light clients for household appliances.”

She chews in silence. Then, quietly. 

“Would it notice if I left?”

“What?”

“The toothbrush. If it runs a client. Would it notice if I walked out?”

He finally looks up. Blinks. Frowns.

“It’s just… a hardware joke.”

She stands, takes her plate. “You’re in love with latency stats.”

“What does that mean?”

“Average response time: 14.2 seconds. Last message read: 47 minutes ago. Time to be ‘right there, babe’: three days and counting.”

She walks out. The door clicks.

He stares at the door, then turns back to the screen.

Types: sudo systemctl restart ntpd

He watches the cursor blink for a moment, then runs the command again. Just in case.

The node re-synchronizes. The chair across from him is still empty.

One of them, at least, is back in consensus.
