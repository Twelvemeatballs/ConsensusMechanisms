## Everyone Got Something But You  

Travel Warning: Q3 Advisory  

Do  not attempt to cross the claim fields unprepared. The terrain appears welcoming: flat, accessible, even generous. This is a lie. The air is full of expectations and wallet dust. The locals are feral. The newcomers are worse.  

The landscape remembers the hunger.  

If you go, bring sunscreen, plausible deniability, and three forms of contribution. Leave your dignity at the gate. You won't need it.  

This is where the airdrops landed. Or rather, detonated. Tokens scattered across wallets like pollen, or shrapnel. Eligibility was whispered, not declared. Some said it favored contributors. Others said it punished activity that looked too much like affection. The algorithm tried to filter out sybils but in the process, it unpersoned half the chain.  

Someone lived here, once. Briefly. Airdrops simply appeared, like wild garlic in the forest, free for the taking if you were at the right place at the right time.  

Then the pilgrims began arriving, clutching half-completed quests and spreadsheets of transaction hashes. Some kept receipts. Others brought long Twitter threads in defence of their devotion. It didn't matter. The logic had already calcified. If you were miscategorised, you stayed that way.  

One man spun up 214 wallets in a single night and still qualified for nothing. Another posted just a thank-you gif and received governance. No one knows why.Â  They heard the call. They answered. But mostly what came back was silence and a handful of worthless tokens.  

They say that if you idle too long, you become a watch-only address in your own story.  

The ghosts wander still, insisting that they were early contributors, still clutching wallets that once held weight. Men and women who dreamed of lambos and received only sodium packets. Erased. Misaligned. They wander the claim fields looking for signs of recognition.   

The tokens unlocked too late and meant too little. They still exist, somewhere.  

The gardens are long gone. Launch promises scatter across the dust like tumbleweeds.  

The claim fields know who you are. And they're not coming back for you.
