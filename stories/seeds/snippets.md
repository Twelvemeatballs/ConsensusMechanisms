- Once, a dev deployed a contract here with no cap, no controls, just minting, endlessly minting. The air still smells like solvent and regret. You’ll know you’re close when everything feels… too cheap. The locals don’t speak about it directly. They just nod at the gas station, and say: “Don’t connect. Not even read-only.”

The dev team is silent. If you go there, bring a friend who knows how to fork reality. And remember: the slippage is always worse than it looks.
